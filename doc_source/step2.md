# Connect Your Directory<a name="step2"></a>

Connecting an AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory to AWS SSO provides users in that directory with a personalized user portal from which they can easily launch multiple AWS accounts or cloud applications\. Users sign in to the portal using their corporate credentials and have one\-click access to all applications and AWS accounts that you have previously authorized\. Optionally, you can also connect an AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory with your on\-premises Active Directory\.

Depending on which directory type you are trying to set up, follow one of the procedures below:
+ [Connect AWS SSO to an AWS Managed Microsoft AD Directory](connectonpremad.md)
+ [Connect AWS SSO to an On\-Premises Active Directory](connectawsad.md)

For more information about supported directory types, see [Manage Your Connected Directory](manage-connected-directory.md)\.
