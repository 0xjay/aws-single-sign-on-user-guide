# Choose Your Directory<a name="step2"></a>

Choosing a directory determines where AWS SSO looks for users and groups that need SSO access\. By default, you get an AWS SSO directory for quick and easy user management\. Optionally, you can also connect an AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory with your on\-premises Active Directory\.

AWS SSO provides users in this directory with a personalized user portal from which they can easily launch multiple AWS accounts or cloud applications\. Users sign in to the portal using their corporate credentials or with credentials they set up in AWS SSO\. Once they sign in, they have one\-click access to all applications and AWS accounts that you have previously authorized\.

Depending on which directory type you are trying to set up, review the topics below for guidance:
+ [Manage Your AWS SSO Directory](manage-your-directory-sso.md)
+ [Connect to Your Microsoft AD Directory](manage-your-directory-connected.md)

For more information about supported directory types, see [Manage Your Directory](manage-your-directory.md)\.
