# Using the User Portal<a name="using-the-portal"></a>

Your user portal provides you with single sign\-on access to all your AWS accounts and most commonly used cloud applications such as Office 365, Concur, Salesforce, and many more\. From here you can quickly launch multiple applications simply by choosing the AWS account or application con in the portal\. The presence of icons in your portal means that an administrator or designated help desk employee from your company has granted you access to those AWS accounts or applications\. It also means that you can access all these accounts or applications from the portal without additional sign\-in prompts\.

Contact your administrator or help desk to request additional access in the following situations:

+ You don't see an AWS account or application that you need access to\.

+ The access that you have to a given account or application is not what you expected\.

## Tips for Using the Portal<a name="portaltips"></a>

Like any business tool or application that you use on a daily basis, the user portal might not work as you expected\. If that happens, try these tips:

+ Occasionally, you may need to sign out and sign back in to the user portal\. This might be necessary to access new applications that your administrator recently assigned to you\. This is not required, however, because all new applications are refreshed every hour\.

+ When you sign in to the user portal, you can open any of the applications listed in the portal by choosing the applicationâ€™s icon\. After you are done using the application, you can either close the application or sign out of the user portal\. Closing the application signs you out of that application only\. Any other applications that you have opened from the user portal remain open and running\. 

+ Before you can sign in as a different user, you must first sign out of the user portal\. Signing out from the portal completely removes your credentials from the browser session\.
