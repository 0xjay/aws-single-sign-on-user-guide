# Set Up SSO to Your Cloud Applications<a name="step4"></a>

Depending on which application type you are trying to set up, follow one of the procedures below:

+ [Add and Configure a Cloud Application](saasapps.md#addconfigsaasapp)

+ [Add and Configure a Custom SAML 2\.0 Application](samlapps.md#addconfigcustomapp)

For more information about supported application types, see [Manage SSO to Your Applications](manage-your-applications.md)\.

Once you complete the appropriate procedure, you will have successfully configured AWS SSO and set up a trust with your service provider\. Your users can now access these applications from within their user portal based on the permissions you assigned\.
