# User Authentications<a name="authconcept"></a>

When a user signs in to the user portal using their username, AWS SSO redirects the request to the AWS SSO authentication service based on the domain associated with their email address\. Once authenticated, users have SSO access to any of the AWS accounts and third\-party software as a service \(SaaS\) applications that show up in the portal without additional sign\-in prompts\. This means that users no longer need to keep track of multiple account credentials for the various assigned AWS applications that they use on a daily basis\.
